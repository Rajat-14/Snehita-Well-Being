          <br />
          The Snehita Well Being Website was conceived as part of the CP301
          project to address the growing need for mental health resources and
          support within the IIT Ropar community. Through collaborative efforts
          and guidance from our mentors, the project team worked diligently to
          create a user-friendly platform offering various features to enhance
          student well-being.
